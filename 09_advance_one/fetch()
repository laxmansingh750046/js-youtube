 fetch()
 
The fetch() function initiates a network request and returns a Promise that resolves to the response.

Microtask Queue: When the Promise returned by fetch() resolves, its .then() callbacks are placed in the microtask queue. 
Microtasks have higher priority than macrotasks (like those scheduled with setTimeout).

Two-Phase Operation:
  1-Request Initiation: fetch() sends the HTTP request over the network.

  2-Response Handling: Upon receiving the response, the Promise is settled, 
      and the appropriate callbacks (onFulfilled or onRejection) are queued as microtasks.
  

  Private Fields: Internally, fetch() may utilize private fields such as data, 
  onFulfilled[], and onRejection[] to manage the state and callbacks of the Promise. 
  These are not accessible to developers and are handled by the JavaScript engine.
