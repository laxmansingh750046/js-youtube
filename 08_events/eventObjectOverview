JavaScript Event Object & Event Listeners Notes
1. Event Object (e)
Automatically passed to event handlers.
Contains info about the event: type, target element, coordinates, timestamp, etc.
Inherits from specific event prototypes (e.g., PointerEvent for pointer-related events).

2. e.type
String indicating the event type (e.g., "click", "keydown").

3. keydown Event
Occurs when a key is pressed down on the keyboard.

Example:
element.addEventListener('keydown', e => {
  console.log('Key pressed:', e.key);
});


4. Third Parameter in addEventListener
   Controls event listener options.
   Boolean â€” true for capturing, false (default) for bubbling.

5. e.timeStamp
   Time in milliseconds since the page started loading when the event occurred.

6. e.target
   The element that originally triggered the event.

7. Attaching One Event Listener to Multiple Elements
   Use querySelectorAll + forEach:

 document.querySelectorAll('.btn').forEach(btn => {
   btn.addEventListener('click', e => {
     console.log('Clicked:', e.target.textContent);
   });
  });
Or use event delegation by adding listener to a common parent and checking e.target.

8. Event Delegation
   Attach listener to parent. Detect event source via e.target.
   Efficient and supports dynamic elements.
   
   Example:
   parentElement.addEventListener('click', e => {
     if(e.target.matches('.btn')) {
       console.log('Clicked:', e.target.textContent);
     }
   });

9. e.toElement
  Non-standard, mostly IE.
  Refers to element mouse moved to during mouseout/mouseover.
  Use standard e.relatedTarget instead.

10. e.srcElement
  Non-standard, old IE property.
  Equivalent to standard e.target.

11. e.currentTarget
  The element to which the event listener is attached during event propagation
  Differs from target which is the original event source.

12. Mouse Coordinates Properties
    Property	Meaning
    clientX	X coordinate relative to the viewport (browser visible area)
    clientY	Y coordinate relative to the viewport
    screenX	X coordinate relative to the physical screen (monitor)
    screenY	Y coordinate relative to the physical screen
